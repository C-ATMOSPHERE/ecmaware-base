CS:GO Hack made in NodeJS using memoryjs (21.01.2020).

Features:
- Aim Helper ( not quaternion based )
- Glow ( thanks to infeeble )
- prototype movement recorder (made for fun).

I will no longer update this.
This needs to be compiled using node-gyp ( node-gyp rebuild ).

Used infeeble base as reference.
