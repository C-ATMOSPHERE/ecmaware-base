> Updated July 2020

* Added GUI and improved some stuff.


Features:
- Aim Helper ( not quaternion based )
- Glow ( thanks to infeeble )
- prototype movement recorder (made for fun).

I will no longer update this.
This needs to be compiled using node-gyp ( node-gyp rebuild ).

Used infeeble base as reference.
